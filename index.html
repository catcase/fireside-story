        <p>It was a dark and stormy night... I went out  into the storm and I got lost in the woods. It was really scarry but I finally made it back safely to my house. Since that dreadful day I have not gone out at night again. I fear storms and do not want to take a chance ever again. </p>

        <p>The next day was a lot better. The storm had passed and the sun was shining. I stepped outside of my front door and felt the fear instantly lifted. My stomach grumbled. It was time to eat.</p>

        <p>I love eating! I can enumerate several types of food that comes to mind right now. I like italian food, chinese, thai and most american fast food as well. I enjoy cooking but I mostly cook the same mush every day.</p>

        <p>Now where to go.. what to cook? Nah, I'm too lazy to cook today. Fast food it is! Do you ever actually have food to cook at home, but neglect it day after day? Then you hear this little voice inside of your head, most likely your mom, that says, "WE HAVE FOOD AT HOME!" That happens to me way more than it probably should...</p>
