        <p>It was a dark and stormy night... I went out  into the storm and I got lost in the woods. It was really scarry but I finally made it back safely to my house. Since that dreadful day I have not gone out at night again. I fear storms and do not want to take a chance ever again. </p>

        <p>The next day was a lot better. The storm had passed and the sun was shining. I stepped outside of my front door and felt the fear instantly lifted. My stomach grumbled. It was time to eat.</p> 

        I love eating! I can enumerate several types of food that comes to mind right now. I like italian food, chinese, thai and most american fast food as well. I enjoy cooking but I mostly cook the same mush every day.
